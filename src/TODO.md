- [x] Done

## Introduction

- [x] What is the opf problem?
    - [x] Basic description
    - [x] Mathematical formulation
    - [x] Node type binary masks
        - [ ] Example mask
- [x] Why is it important
    - [x] Why energy system operators need to solve it
    - [x] How is it solved today
- [ ] What are the challenges
    - [ ] ML methods
        - [x] Single-topology VS multi-topology
        - [x] Dataset generation
        - [x] Supervised VS unsupervised
        - [ ] Evidence that 1-WL bound nets underperform
        - [ ] JK helps which leads me to believe that adding
          farther away features will help

## Literature overview

- [x] Take a look at the previous literature overview and refine it
    - [x] Current literature doesn't use standard benchmark datasets with fixed splits
    - [x] The use uninterpretable metrics making it hard to interpret their results
    - [x] They usually don't predict the entire state of the grid

## Methodology

How do I plan to improve upon the previous works

- [ ] List and describe the metrics I will use and what they're good for
- [ ] What higher order methods am I going to use and why
- [ ] What dataset am I going to use

## Conclusion

- [ ] Summary
