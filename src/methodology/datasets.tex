\subsection*{Datasets}

To address the inconsistent use of datasets in the literature we will be using
publicly available datasets with a fixed train, validation and test split.
These datasets are being developed by researchers at the Institute for High Voltage
Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy Economics of the RWTH and are
synthetically generated.
They will consist of power grids of single and multiple topology datasets of various
topologies(trees, paths, no particular topology), voltage levels(low, medium and high),
network sizes(from tens of nodes to hundreds) and supply tasks.
