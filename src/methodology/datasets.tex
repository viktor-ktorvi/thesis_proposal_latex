The fact that each research group is developing models on a different dataset makes
comparing different models difficult.
Noticing the lack of standard benchmark datasets for power grid operation,
researchers at the Institute of High Voltage Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy Economics(IAEW),
are developing representative datasets of power grids with a fixed train-validation-test split.
