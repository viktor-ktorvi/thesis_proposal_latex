\subsection*{Datasets}

To address the inconsistent use of datasets in the literature we will be using
datasets publicly available datasets with a fixed train, validation and test split.
These datasets being developed by researchers at the Institute for High Voltage
Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy Economics of the RWTH and is
synthetically generated.
They will consist of power grids of single and multiple topology datasets of various
voltage levels, network sizes and supply tasks.
