To improve the interpretability of the metrics used to assess the quality of the achieved OPF solution
we introduce a few metrics with regard to each of the constituents of the optimization problem:
the equality constraints, the inequality constraints and the objective function.
The metrics categories are given in descending order with respect to their importance.
Equality constraints are the most important because the solution must obey the laws of physics;
then come the inequality constraints representing the technical (and regulatory) limitations
which must be fulfilled for the proper functioning of the power grid;
finally, the objective function value comes last in priority because only when the
first two constraints are fulfilled can we start thinking about minimizing costs.
