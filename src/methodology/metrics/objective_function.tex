For the objective function we'll be looking at the function value itself, calling it the cost $C$.
Additionally, we can, in the supervised case, look at the ratio of the
cost and the target cost achieved by the conventional solver.
Both of these metrics are defined in table~\ref{tab:objectivefunctionmetrics}.
