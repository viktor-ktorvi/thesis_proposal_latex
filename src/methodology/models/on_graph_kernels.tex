Finally and somewhat counterintuitively, we suggest to explore the use of graph kernels in combination with linear regression methods.
This goes against what we would like to achieve with the use of neural networks - that is to automate the feature engineering process
by replacing it with learned feature extraction.
However, given that we've demonstrated that the OPF problem can be solved with a satisfactory degree of precision by concatenating
node features and applying ridge regression, a method with an analytical solution, skipping the somewhat expensive training process,
it makes sense to try to generalize that approach to multi-topology datasets with the use of graph kernels.
