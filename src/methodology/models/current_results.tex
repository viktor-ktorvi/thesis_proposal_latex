To analyze the current state of applying graph neural networks to
OPF in table \textcolor{red}{REF} we provide the results of training four models, each having access to
wider neighbourhood information.
The details of how the models were selected and trained can be found in \textcolor{red}{APPENDIX}.
Intuitively, to solve the conservation of energy equations, one would need information on the
state of all the nodes in the grid.
Doing this for single-topology datasets is simple as we only need to concatenate the
features of each node into a vector and fit, for instance, a linear model to it and this does, as seen in
table \textcolor{red}{REF}, solve the problem with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.
However, if we want train models on a multi-topology dataset, which is a real world use case,
this approach will not work as the classical machine learning algorithms cannot work with
this data due to the varying number of features in the entire graph.
It is for this reason that we have to resort to graph learning approaches.
In the same table, we see the effects of applying: a linear model to each node separately;
a GCN which incorporates the local neighbourhood of each node; and a GCN with jumping
knowledge which enables the GCN to have a bit more depth and thus reach more nodes.
