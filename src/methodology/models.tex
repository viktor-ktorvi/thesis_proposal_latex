\subsection*{Models}
TODO
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let's have a table comparing single-/multi-topology and like linear regression vs GCN
    \item It'd be good to have an appendix where the model is drawn with all the masks and scalers,
    as well as how the hyperparameter search was performed.
    \item Let's talk about how having the global information is needed for the conservation of energy
    part, but we also need gnns to handle multiple topologies
    \item Then we introduce the possible architectures to try
    \item I need to see what makes sense to use - like, graph kernels can't take attributes as far as I
    know so that's a no-go; I think k-WL and the likes can take attributes(I need to study them further),
    but the complexity could make the infeasible; then graph transformers, there's a lot to talk about there
\end{itemize}
