\indent Of the values in the vectors $\boldsymbol{P}, \boldsymbol{Q}, \boldsymbol{V}$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$,
which, along with the admittance matrix, fully describe the state of a grid, not all are variables in the optimization problem.
In fact, some are constant, and which value is constant and which isn't is determined on the node level by the type of node the value belongs to.
Nodes can be one of three types: Slack(reference), PQ and PVAR.
Table~\ref{tab:nodemasks} contains the binary masks for each node type and value where $1$ indicates a constant quantity and $0$
indicates a variable in the optimization problem.
