\subsection*{Dataset}

The dataset used to obtain the results in
Tables~\ref{tab:equalityconstraintsresults},~\ref{tab:inequalityconstraintsresults} and~\ref{tab:objectivefunctionresults}
was not one of the datasets described in the Methodology because, at the time of writing this proposal, those datasets were not
ready for publication.
Instead, it is generated from a
case30\footnote{\url{https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.13.1/networks/power_system_test_cases.html\#case-30}}
grid by augmenting its $\pqva$ randomly by multiplying each value by a number $u \sim \mathcal{U}(0.9, 1.1)$.
Ironically, this is exactly what we were arguing against because of reproducibility issues, however the
results still stand.
Due to it being derived from a single grid, the dataset is a single-topology dataset.
It consist of 3000 samples, a number found not to lead to overfitting, divided into a train and validation
set in a 2:1 ratio.
All the results are presented on the validation set.
