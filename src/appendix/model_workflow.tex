The supervised models consist of a standard regression pipeline (with problem specific modifications) depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:model_pipeline}.
The input to the pipeline is the solved grid state matrix $\pqva \inrnxfour$ ($N$ denotes the number of nodes in a graph) which
is first multiplied by the binary $\maskconstvar \in \{0, 1\}^{N \times 4}$ to delete the target information.
This produces the matrix $\pqva_{const} \inrnxfour$ which is fed into a standard scaler to standardize the features.
The standardized feature matrix $Z_{in}$ goes into one of the models whose output is $Z_{out}$.
The dimensions of $Z_{in}$ and $Z_{out}$ are model specific.
$Z_{out}$ is fed through an inverse
standard scaler to produce $X_{out} \inrnxfour$ after which $\notmaskconstvar$ is applied to leave only the
approximation of the variables of the OPF problem $\approxpqva_{var} \inrnxfour$.
Those are, finally, combined with the constants to create a full approximation of the optimal grid state $\approxpqva \inrnxfour$.
An example of a real data sample is shown in Table~\ref{tab:dataexample}.
The different model types are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:linear_local},~\ref{fig:gnn_model} and~\ref{fig:linear_global}.
